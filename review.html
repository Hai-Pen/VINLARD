	<body>
		<center><p><b>Review Chapter 01: End of Normal Life</b><br><a class="hover"=href=http://www.dreame.com/user?authorId=tZFfM0k3VyAWN311Cu0GQw%3D%3D> Hai-Pen</br></a></p></center>
		
		<p>In this <a class="nodec"href="http://www.dreame.com/chapter/%2BrtuZkQ6pVBG8usX1ch36w%3D%3D.html"> chapter one</a> tells that, Sin often dreamed about the tragedy that happened to him 10 years ago. Where at that time, he lose both of his parents. At that time, Sin killed his uncle who had taken the live of his parents. However in this chapter, we still don't know how Sin killed his uncle?</p>
		
		<p>In this capter one, Sin tell about his life after the tragedy happened. His life as the last heir of the Vinlard family. He become sole owner of the company called Vinlard Corp. Vinlard Corp itself is a modern company that is recognized by the whole country. therefore, since then Sin's normal life ended.</p>
		
		<p>In this chapter also features two characters who are likely to be important figures in the story. The following are the two figures:</p>

		<p>The first characther is a woman named Marry. It was first shown when he walked into Sin's room to wake her up. Later, she is also featured in Sin's story as a maid. Sin described her as a short-haired woman wearing a slightly revealing maid costume.</p>

		<p>The second character is a loyal male servant named Apholo. Apholo is shown when Sin tells about his past. Based on Sin's story, he declared an inheritance letter that was mandated by Sin's father to him for Sin. Sin also described Apholo as a man with glasses with a large body and wearing a tailcoat.</p>
		
		<P>Maybe that's all i can review for this chapter one. I will review it again if you want and of course after the second chapter has been uploaded. Don't forget to follow the author of <a class="hover"=href="http://www.dreame.com/user?authorId=tZFfM0k3VyAWN311Cu0GQw%3D%3D"> Hai-Pen.</a></p>
